Resource Pool is a Radiome structure to feed resources to workflows, and store resources generated by the workflows. As a key-value mapping, it provides the relation between ResourceKey and Resource, with the advantage of querying features so sub-select specific ResourceKeys:

```python
from radiome.core.resource_pool import ResourcePool, ResourceKey as R, Resource

rp = ResourcePool()

rp[R('sub-A00008326_ses-BAS2_task-pCASL_bold')] = \
    Resource('s3://fcp-indi/data/Projects/RocklandSample/RawDataBIDSLatest/sub-A00008326/ses-BAS2/func/sub-A00008326_ses-BAS2_task-pCASL_bold.nii.gz')
```

The `ResourceKey` class takes a `String` or a set of keywork arguments, which uses the keyword as BIDS keys.

```python
from radiome.core.resource_pool import ResourceKey as R

# All these examples represent the same ResourceKey

R('sub-A00008326_ses-BAS2_task-pCASL_bold')
R('bold', sub='A00008326', ses='BAS2', task='pCASL')
R(sub='A00008326', ses='BAS2', task='pCASL', suffix='bold')
R('task-pCASL_bold', sub='A00008326', ses='BAS2')
```

This class is specialized to act as subsets and supersets of other `ResourceKeys`, enabling its usage as filters in the `ResourcePool`.

```python
# subset âŠ† superset
R('sub-A00008326_ses-BAS2_bold') in R('sub-A00008326_bold')
```

and it has two query operators: `*` and `^`. The asterisk allow to filter for `ResourceKeys` that has any value for a specific key, but the key is present. For the carret operator, it filter for `ResourceKeys` that does not has a specific key:

```python
R('sub-A00008326_ses-BAS2_bold') in R('sub-*_ses-BAS2_bold')
R('sub-A00008326_ses-BAS2_bold') in R('sub-*_ses-*_bold')
R('sub-A00008326_bold') not in R('sub-A00008326_ses-*_bold')

R('sub-A00008326_bold') in R('sub-A00008326_ses-^_bold')
R('sub-A00008326_ses-BAS2_bold') not in R('sub-A00008326_ses-^_bold')
```

To handle different preprocessing strategies, a specialization of the ResourcePool and ResourceKey are created.

```python
R('sub-A00008326_desc-skullstripping-afni+nuis-gsr_bold')
```

This structure makes it possible to match resources from the same stragety in a StrategyResourcePool, or resources from previous steps, e.g.:

```python

# These resources participate in the same

R('sub-A00008326_T1w')
R('sub-A00008326_desc-skullstripping-afni_mask')
R('sub-A00008326_desc-skullstripping-afni+nuis-gsr_bold')
```
