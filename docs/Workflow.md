## What Is Workflow?

In neuroimaging, a **pipeline** is a set of data processing elements connected in series, where the output of one element is the input of the next one. A **workflow** is a single data processing element, which may pull data from resource pools,  create various **jobs** (such as Python functions or Nipype interfaces) to process it, and save result back to resource pools for further use.

### How To Use Workflow?

Workflows are distributed as **namespace Python packages**. All workflows are under `radiome.workflows` namespace. Install them using `pip`, just as what you did to install other Python packages, add a new **step** in pipeline config file and provide necessary parameters. Workflows will be resolved automatically by Radiome at runtime.

### Understand Inputs Of Workflow

There are two types of inputs for a workflow.

1. Resource: anatomical and functional image files, intermediate results, masks, templates, etc. All resources are organized in the global resource pool following BIDS standard.
2. Parameters: arguments that control the behavior of workflows, such as factors, booleans and flags. Radiome will read these parameters from pipeline config file and pass them into workflows.

### How Workflows Work

The entry point of a workflow is always `create_workflow(params, resource_pool, context)` function.

1.  Validate `params` against a schema in `spec.yml` to check whether types, ranges and other constraints are correct.

2. Select `resources ` from `resource pool` based on some rules.

3. Use functions, nipype interfaces or other tools to process `resources`. The outputs of current step can be connected to the inputs of next steps. For example:

   ```python
   anat_deoblique = NipypeJob(interface=afni.Refit(deoblique=True))
   anat_deoblique.in_file = anatomical_image
   anat_reorient = NipypeJob(interface=afni.Resample(orientation='RPI', outputtype='NIFTI_GZ'))
   anat_reorient.in_file = anat_deoblique.out_file
   ```

4. Save the final result back to `resource pool`, so that it can be produced in the final outputs and used by other workflows.

### Where Are Outputs

Given that results reside in `resource pool`, their produced files can be found in `$output_dir/derivatives/{workflow_name}` after the pipefine completes.
